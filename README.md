# N Layer Neural Network
A Python program that can create a N layer neural network. 

## General Info
The provided code is set up to train and test on the cat vs non-cat datasets.

The architecture of the neural network can be changed by altering the layer_dims variable on line 65 of NeuralNetworkApp.py. With len(layer_dims) being the number of hidden layers in the neural network and layer_dims[i] being the number of neurons in layer i.

This is a project from DeepLearning.AI's Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.
